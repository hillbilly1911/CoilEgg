The CoilEgg plugin is a fun and lightweight Minecraft addition for Paper servers, offering players a unique way to interact with each other.
With the /egg command, players can throw eggs at others, provided they have the coilegg.use permission. 
If an egg simply flies through the air, no extra messages are shown to keep things unobtrusive.
However, if the egg hits another player, a playful message saying "You've been egged!" pops up in the chat, letting everyone know about the successful hit.
The plugin also includes a 3-second cooldown for the command to ensure fair play and prevent spam. It's a simple yet engaging way to add some laughter to your server!
